## Official laboratories scheduling

Currently, CrownLabs does not introduce any limitations to the users regarding when they can log-in into the system and spawn new VMs.
Hence, students can access their environments at **any time**, to complete the laboratories at their own convenience, as well as to practice with new topics.

However, to guarantee a satisfactory experience to everyone, please periodically **check the calendar** below and do your best to **avoid spawning new VMs when the official laboratories are scheduled** and the system load is high. You can quickly check the current **system load** through the **Grafana button** available in your own dashboard. Additionally, remember to **delete your own VMs** when you no longer need them.

**Beware:** in case of official laboratories accessed by a high number of students, older VMs may be **terminated by the administrators without any advice** in case the system load reaches a critical threshold.
