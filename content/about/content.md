## About CrownLabs

CrownLabs is currently **developed**, **maintained** and **operated** by a group of volunteers, mainly MSc students in Computer Engineering, enrolled at [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it), Italy.

All the work is done for **fun** and for **learning**. It is a nice surprise to see to which extent the university lectures are really useful in the real work, but also how much additional work is needed to apply the learnt theory to practice.

**New volunteers are always welcome**, especially because students (sooner or leader) graduate and slowly decrease their involvement here!



## History
This service was set up in about three weeks by a group of students enrolled in the MSc of Computing Engineering at Politecnico di Torino (Italy), under the pressure of the Coronavirus, in March 2020.

This virus hit hard the entire country; all students were sent home, the University set up private video conferencing servers in a few days, and classes were transformed into remote lectures.

However, there was no answer for labs, in particular computing labs. How can students practice with their coding labs, simulations, cloud, networking?

The CrownLabs project was set up to answer to this question: a group of volunteering students decided to put their theorethical knowledge into practice.

It was a wonderful ride: creating the team, sharing the knowledge of different people, defining the objectives, assigning the tasks, a lot of collaboration, a lot of day and night work.

The result was a nice playground for everybody: we demonstrated that with the proper knowledge, team spirit, and a great extent of sacrifice, we can achieve great results.
And, we gave birth to this project, which may be useful also outside our University.


## Why CrownLabs?
In Italian, *Corona* means *Crown*.
The name *CrownLabs* is the logical consequence: a project born under the pressure of the (nasty) Coronavirus!


## Current team

TODO


## Original team
Given the way this project was set up at the beginning, it is worth mentioning all the people who spend their nights on it.

![Fulvio Risso](/images/fulvio.jpg "Fulvio Risso")                | **Fulvio Risso**, project leader, tester. Nobody knows what he does. Always in some calls.
![Giuseppe Ognibene](/images/giuseppe.jpg "Giuseppe Ognibene")    | **Giuseppe Ognibene**, "Give me a probe, and I'll dominate the world". Prometheus can never relax, with Giuseppe around.

![Mattia Lavacca](/images/mattia.jpg "Mattia Lavacca")            | **Mattia Lavacca**, "I want to start a PhD!". Instead, he did CI/CD in a magnificent way. Not really a topic for PhD students.
![Serena Flocco](/images/serena.jpg "Serena Flocco")              | **Serena Flocco**, "I don't have Internet at home, how can I create the GUI?". Really hard to work when forced to stay home, without Internet.
