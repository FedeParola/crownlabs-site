## History
This service was set up in about three weeks by a group of students enrolled in the MSc of Computing Engineering at Politecnico di Torino (Italy), under the pressure of the Coronavirus, in March 2020.

This virus hit hard the entire country; all students were sent home, the University set up private video conferencing servers in a few days, and classes were transformed into remote lectures.

However, there was no answers for labs, in particular computing labs. How can students practice with their coding labs, simulations, cloud, networking?
To answer this question, the CrownLabs project brought together a group of volunteering students who decided to put their theorethical knowledge into practice.
It was a wonderful ride: creating the team, sharing the knowledge owned by different people, defining the objectives, assigning the tasks, a lot of collaboration, a lot of day and night work.

The result was a nice playground for everybody: we demonstrated that with the proper knowledge, team spirit, and a great extent of sacrifice, we can achieve great results.
And, we started this project, which may be useful also outside the University.

## People
Given the way this project was set up at the beginning, it is worth mentioning all the people who spend their nights on it.

![Aldo Lacuku](/images/aldo.jpg "Aldo Lacuku")
**Aldo Lacuku**, "To authenticate, you have to come to me". He really knows about security. He also knows the boss of the hosting room, which was very helpful indeed.

![Alex Palesandro](/images/alex.jpg "Alex Palesandro")
**Alex Palesandro**, The true leader, manager, developer, tester. Nothing can be done without him.

![Andrea Cossio](/images/andrea.jpg "Andrea Cossio")
**Andrea Cossio**, "I know how to connect to the VM". He knows VNC more than the actual developers.

![Francesco Borgogni](/images/francesco.jpg "Francesco Borgogni")
**Francesco Borgogni**, "Kubernetes CRDs are my future". Give him to a CRD to create, code will come in minutes.

![Fulvio Risso](/images/fulvio.jpg "Fulvio Risso")
**Fulvio Risso**, project leader, tester. Nobody knows what he does. Always in some calls.

![Giuseppe Ognibene](/images/giuseppe.jpg "Giuseppe Ognibene")
**Giuseppe Ognibene**, "Give me a probe, and I'll dominate the world". Prometheus can never relax, with Giuseppe around.

![Hamza Rhaouati](/images/hamza.jpg "Hamza Rhaouati")
**Hamza Rhaouati**, "Divide et impera". With him, you don't have to worry about scalability.

![Marco Iorio](/images/marco.jpg "Marco Iorio")
**Marco Iorio**, "No words, only facts". Whatever he does (silently), you can be sure that it will be perfect.

![Mattia Lavacca](/images/mattia.jpg "Mattia Lavacca")
**Mattia Lavacca**, "I want to start a PhD!". Instead, he did CI/CD in a magnificent way. Not really a topic for PhD students.

![Serena Flocco](/images/serena.jpg "Serena Flocco")
**Serena Flocco**, "I don't have Internet at home, how can I create the GUI?". Really hard to work when forced to stay home, without Internet. But ladies are a must in a good looking project: they have always a better taste than (male) engineers.

![Simone Magnani](/images/simone.jpg "Simone Magnani")
**Simone Magnani**, Webservice API developer, "I'll do also what I don't  like at all" (GUIs). Active day and night.

![Stefano Galantino](/images/stefano.jpg "Stefano Galantino")
**Stefano Galantino**, "To enter, you have to pass on my body". He is the only one who knows about Kubernetes ingress controllers.
